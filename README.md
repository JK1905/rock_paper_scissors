# rock_paper_scissors

This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of The Odin Project. The main focus was to practice JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive web development.

The game contains:

- Clickable image-based buttons for "rock", "paper", and "scissors" instead of text input.
- A computer opponent that randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors each round.
- Real-time score tracking displayed under the images.
- Notifications that show the result of each round and highlight the winner when someone reaches 5 points.
- Smooth hover animations for the choices to enhance interactivity.

## What I learned

- Using JavaScript functions to organize code (`getHumanChoice`, `getComputerChoice`, `playRound`, `updateScoreDisplay`, `checkWinner`)
- DOM manipulation with `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, and `querySelectorAll`
- Adding event listeners to interactive elements (`click` events on images)
- Updating the webpage dynamically instead of using `console.log`
- Using CSS for styling elements, hover effects, and animations
- Handling game logic and score resets when a player wins
- Using template literals to display dynamic content in HTML
- Structuring a small project and documenting it with a README

## How to play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click one of the three images to make your choice.
4. The computer will automatically choose its move.
5. Scores and round results are displayed beneath the images.
6. The first player to reach 5 points is declared the winner, and the game automatically resets.

## Notes

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Images are used as buttons for a more interactive experience.
- Hovering over a choice slightly enlarges and rotates it to indicate it’s clickable.
- The winner notification appears prominently and disappears after a short animation.
- The game runs entirely in the browser—no console input is needed.
- CSS and JS are used together to create dynamic, visually appealing interactions.

## Assets

- `rock.png`, `paper.png`, `scissors.png` – Image for the Rock choice

These images are used as interactive buttons for making choices in the game.
=======
- The game is entirely console-based; no additional UI is implemented.
- All input is case-insensitive.
- Scores are tracked internally and displayed inside the console after each round.
